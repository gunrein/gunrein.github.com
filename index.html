      <p>
        A user-centric software engineering and product leader, advisor, and investor who loves to build software, help people, talk with users,
        and design solutions. I can both lead and manage organizations as well as directly do the hands-on work for design, implementation,
        deployment, customer discovery, and business+product strategy, but I don't meddle and I bias heavily toward delegating to high performers.
        I'm particularly interested in observability, monitoring, measurement, resilience, continuous learning, fast
        cycle times, methodology, simplicity, and great user+developer experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a hobby I work on forest and riparian conservation with my family as part of Buncombe Hollow Forest and similar volunteer activities.

        <a href="/wallowa/">Wallowa</a> is the beginning of a tool for measuring your
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">SDLC</a> that I've
        wanted in my past two engineering leadership roles. It is focused on providing
        straightforward, flexible, and transparent insights into system-level behaviors.

                  At Reclaim I primarily focus on engineering but do some product design for the projects I’m involved in.
                  The work ranges from building new features to prototyping to supporting customers. So far I’ve made
                  improvements to the core prioritization and scheduling algorithms, introduced the use of partition tables
                  in PostgreSQL, explored the use of LLMs for specific use cases, and helped complete several projects as a
                  leader and programmer, mostly in Java with a little TypeScript.

              <td>March 2023 - October 2023</td>
              <td><p><strong>Explored observability startup ideas</strong></p>
                <p>
                I left Hasura to explore several product ideas for observability solutions. The premises of the explorations were:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    OpenTelemetry has reached a point of maturity that it should be central in most organizations observability strategies
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Developer attention is valuable and limited so provide a UX that is portable across backends (I believe this is possible given OpenTelemetry as a basis)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Open source ingest, query, and storage solutions have reached a point that organizations producing significant telemetry can achieve better outcomes (developer experience, flexibility, performance, cost) than with incumbent vendors
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There is general dissatisfaction with the fragmented landscape of tools
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The prices for observability tools are too high
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  I built several prototypes and talked with many people about their needs as users and buyers of observability solutions.
                  Ultimately I didn’t find a wedge into the market that I liked for a startup. The prototypes and ideas focused in these areas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Widely distributed storage of telemetry while maintaining great query ergonomics (rather than shipping it to a central location) (not open source)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    UI that fully embraces OpenTelemetry semantics and blends the telemetry types in useful ways (not open source)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Yet another dashboard system, but intended to be portable for developers and vendor-neutral. A few more details are available at
                    <a href="https://github.com/gunrein/westdash">https://github.com/gunrein/westdash</a>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  During this time I also built and published <a href="/wallowa/">Wallowa</a> as a side project using DuckDB, Rust, TypeScript.
                  Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/gunrein/wallowa">https://github.com/gunrein/wallowa</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I continue to build observability tools on the side.
