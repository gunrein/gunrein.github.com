      <div>
        A user-centric software engineering and product leader, advisor, and investor who loves to help people, talk with users, design, and program.
        I can lead, manage, and directly do the hands-on work for design, implementation, deployment, customer
        discovery, and business+product strategy. I'm particularly interested in
        observability, monitoring, measurement, resilience, continuous learning, fast cycle times, methodology,
        simplicity, and great user+developer experiences.
